8.	General
End User shall be solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations with respect to End User’s possession and use of the Software, including, without limitation, the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. Section 2751 et seq. and the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, as well as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (IITARs) and the Export Administration Regulations (EARs).

Any waiver of a failure or delay in performance shall be effective only if in a writing signed by both parties, and only in accordance with its terms. The waiver of one breach or default shall not constitute the waiver of any subsequent breach or default and shall not act to amend or negate the rights of the parties under this Agreement.

End User authorizes Licensor to identify End User in marketing literature as a “customer” of Licensor.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois, and the End User hereby submits to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of that state. All disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be heard exclusively in the courts of Cook County, Illinois, and the parties hereby consent to jurisdiction and venue in all such courts.

If End User uses or attempts to use all or any part of the Software beyond the scope of the license granted hereunder, then Licensor may seek and obtain such temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief (without the necessity of filing or posting a bond or other security) as a court of competent jurisdiction may award, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable injury which may not likely be redressed adequately through the payment of money damages alone.

Nothing in this Agreement creates a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent, employer/employee or mutual agency relationship between the parties. No party has any right or power under this Agreement to create any obligation, expressed or implied, on behalf of the other party.

If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable statute, rule of law or public policy then such provision shall be considered inoperative to the extent of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to replace any such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a new provision that has the most nearly similar permissible economic effect.

Headings are included in this Agreement as a matter of convenience only and shall not be controlling with regard to the interpretation of this Agreement.
Either party may assign this Agreement, with written notice to the other party, to a person or entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assigning party’s assets by way of merger, sale, corporate reorganization or otherwise, provided the successor agrees in writing to assume all the obligations stated hereunder.
